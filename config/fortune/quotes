%
Care about your craft. Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?
%
Provide options dont make lame excuses. Instead of excuses provide options. Dont say it cant be done; explain what can be done.
%
Be a catalyst for change. You cant force change on people. Instead show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.
%
Make quality a requirements issue. Involve your users in determining the projects real quality requirements.
%
Critically analyze what you read and hear. Dont be swayed by vendors media hype or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.
%
DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself. Every piece of knowledge must have a single unambiguous authoritative representation within a system.
%
Eliminate effects between unrelated things. Design components that are self-contained independent and have a single well-defined purpose.
%
Use tracer bullets to find the target. Tracer bullets let you home in on your target by trying things and seeing how close they land.
%
Program close to the problem domain. Design and code in your users language.
%
Iterate the schedule with the code. Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time scales.
%
Use the power of command shells. Use the shell when graphical user interfaces dont cut it.
%
Always use source code control. Source code control is a time machine for your work - you can go back.
%
Dont panic when debugging Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.
%
Dont assume it prove it. Prove your assumptions in the actual environment with real data and boundary conditions.
%
Write code that writes code. Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.
%
Design With contracts. Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.
%
Use assertions to prevent the impossible. Assertions validate your assumptions. Use them to protect your code from an uncertain world.
%
Finish what you start. Where possible the routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.
%
Configure dont integrate. Implement technology choices for an application as configuration options not through integration or engineering.
%
Analyze workflow to improve concurrency. Exploit concurrency in your users workflow.
%
Always design for concurrency. Allow for concurrency and youll design cleaner interfaces with fewer assumptions.
%
Use blackboards to coordinate workflow. Use blackboards to coordinate disparate facts and agents while maintaining independence and isolation among participants.
%
Estimate the order of your algorithms. Get a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.
%
Refactor early refactor often. Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden rewrite rework and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.
%
Test your software or your users will. Test ruthlessly. Dont make your users find bugs for you.
%
Dont gather requirements
-dig for them. Requirements rarely lie on the surface. Theyre buried deep beneath layers of assumptions misconceptions and politics.
%
Abstractions live longer than details. Invest in the abstraction not the implementation. Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.
%
Dont think outside the box
-find the box. When faced with an impossible problem identify the real constraints. Ask yourself: Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?
%
Some things are better done than described. Dont fall into the specification spiral
-at some point you need to start coding.
%
Costly tools dont produce better designs. Beware of vendor hype industry dogma and the aura of the price tag. Judge tools on their merits.
%
Dont use manual procedures. A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions in the same order time after time.
%
Coding aint done til all the Tests run. Nuff said.
%
Test state coverage not code coverage. Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isnt enough.
%
English is just a programming language. Write documents as you would write code: honor the DRY principle use metadata MVC automatic generation and so on.
%
Gently exceed your users expectations. Come to understand your users expectations then deliver just that little bit more.
%
Think about your work. Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.
%
Dont live with broken windows. Fix bad designs wrong decisions and poor code when you see them.
%
Remember the big picture. Dont get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check whats happening around you.
%
Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio. Make learning a habit.
%
Its both what you say and the way you say it. Theres no point in having great ideas if you dont communicate them effectively.
%
Make it easy to reuse. If its easy to reuse people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.
%
There are no final decisions. No decision is cast in stone. Instead consider each as being written in the sand at the beach and plan for change.
%
Prototype to learn. Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce but in the lessons you learn.
%
Estimate to avoid surprises. Estimate before you start. Youll spot potential problems up front.
%
Keep knowledge in plain text. Plain text wont become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing.
%
Use a single editor well. The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable extensible and programmable.
%
Fix the problem not the blame. It doesnt really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone elses
-it is still your problem and it still needs to be fixed.
%
select isnt broken. It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.
%
Learn a text manipulation language. You spend a large part of each day working with text. Why not have the computer do some of it for you?
%
You cant write perfect software. Software cant be perfect. Protect your code and users from the inevitable errors.
%
Crash early. A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.
%
Use exceptions for exceptional problems. Exceptions can suffer from all the readability and maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code. Reserve exceptions for exceptional things.
%
Minimize coupling between modules. Avoid coupling by writing shy code and applying the Law of Demeter.
%
Put abstractions in code details in metadata. Program for the general case and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.
%
Design using services. Design in terms of services-independent concurrent objects behind well-defined consistent interfaces.
%
Separate views from models. Gain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of models and views.
%
Dont program by coincidence. Rely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity and dont confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.
%
Test your estimates. Mathematical analysis of algorithms doesnt tell you everything. Try timing your code in its target environment.
%
Design to test. Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.
%
Dont use wizard code you dont understand. Wizards can generate reams of code. Make sure you understand all of it before you incorporate it into your project.
%
Work with a user to think like a user. Its the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be used.
%
Use a project glossary. Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and vocabulary for a project.
%
Start when youre ready. Youve been building experience all your life. Dont ignore niggling doubts.
%
Dont be a slave to formal methods. Dont blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and capabilities.
%
Organize teams around functionality. Dont separate designers from coders testers from data modelers. Build teams the way you build code.
%
Test early. Test often. Test automatically. Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on a shelf.
%
Use saboteurs to test your testing. Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify that testing will catch them.
%
Find bugs once. Once a human tester finds a bug it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.
%
Sign your work. Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be too.
%
Think twice code once.
%
No matter how far down the wrong road you have gone turn back now.
%
Why do we never have time to do it right but always have time to do it over?
%
Weeks of programming can save you hours of planning.
